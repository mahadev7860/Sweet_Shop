<h1>It was the year of 1901 in Eluru when Chaina Ram started his massively famous shop selling different kinds of mithai specialising in one called the Godavari Halwa. It was difficult tracing the year when Chaina Ram relocated to Eluru, but what was easy was visiting this legendary place and giving its speciality a taste check! 

From Godavari halwa to Kakinada Kaja, from Kaju Burfi to Bandar Laddu, Chaina Ram will leave you high and happy in more ways than one. This place also serves lip-smacking Chana Poori as a breakfast dish in the wee hours of the morning, so why not head over here first thing this Sunday peeps!</h1>
